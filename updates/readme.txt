HELLO USER

starfish and jerry get part-time jobs as your desktop assistants! they can check the time, give you language lessons, and play music for you. they’re best friends and like to talk to each other. press ‘t’ to listen to them.
ideally they sit on your desktop while you do other stuff and talk to each other every now and then. there's not that much random dialogue now, but i'll add more later. hopefully all the new dialogue will eventually surpass the number of lines in the original dialogue set.

PROTOTYPE 03 (STARFISH):
- remembers your birthday
- plays instruments
- gives music recommendations
- wants to make sure you are healthy

PROTOTYPE 50 (JERRY):
- sits around and looks cute
- discusses relevant topics (frequent updates to accomodate her knowledge of seasonal anime)
- cosplays
- tells you america facts


they celebrate the holidays with you too. currently there is special dialogue for christmas (aka fried chicken day in the commonwealth of caprina), thanksgiving, halloween, september 21st, your birthday, some bulletproof character birthdays, women’s history month, july 4th, ronald reagan’s assassination attempt, and july 26th. feel free to suggest your favorite holidays/other special days and i’ll add them in. religious, secular and commemorative national/international days are all welcomed. the current ones are some special days either i have come up with or ones that my friends have suggested.

also, feel free to request neopronoun options! i didn't see any reason for these two to talk about you in third person considering you're right there, but they'll gossip about you more in the future
